## About Me

I am a student of **Systems Analysis and Development** with a genuine passion for software development and data analysis. I focus on creating practical and efficient solutions that make a real impact. Currently, I am a Data Analysis intern, where I apply advanced tools to transform raw data into strategic insights.

## Experience and Tools

- **Data Analysis Internship**  
  Working with **Excel, VBA, Power BI, Tableau**, and **Oracle SQL**, performing everything from data manipulation and cleaning to creating interactive dashboards to support decision-making.

- **Data Analysis and Big Data**  
  Course focused on Python and its main data science libraries such as **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Plotly**, as well as relational databases (**MySQL**) and **Machine Learning** techniques with **Scikit-Learn**.

- **Java Development**  
  Practical projects that strengthen my skills in object-oriented programming using **Java**, design patterns, **Spring Boot**, **Stream API**, and interface development with **Swing**.
